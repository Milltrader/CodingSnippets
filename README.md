# CodingSnippets

Hello! I'm Artemii, and this repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I dive deeper into the world of Python. Over the past months, I have been continuously improving and building upon my Python skills. This page is a reflection of that journey.

## My Projects
  
 **General Python** 
 
  ![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen?style=flat)
- **Coffee Machine** (https://github.com/Milltrader/redesigned-goggles/blob/main/Coffe_Machine.py): Simulated coffee machine processes and practised classes.
- **Loan Calculator** (https://github.com/Milltrader/redesigned-goggles/blob/main/Credit_Calc.py): Created simple loan calculator and practiced argparse module and calculations in Python.
- **Hangman** (https://github.com/Milltrader/redesigned-goggles/blob/main/Hang_Man.py): Created a hangman game with attempts and score counts. Mostly used functions, while loops and if conditions.

![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow?style=flat)
- **Online Translator** (https://github.com/Milltrader/redesigned-goggles/blob/main/online_translator.py): 
The program interfaces with the Context Reverso translator, allowing users to perform word translations via the terminal, also saving results in a text file, while handling basic exceptions and providing an option to translate into all supported languages. Practiced BeautifulSoup library and interaction with websites.

![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Hard-orange?style=flat)
- **Hacking a Server** (https://github.com/Milltrader/redesigned-goggles/blob/main/hacking_a_server.py): The provided Python script attempts a kind of time-based side-channel attack on a socket server, trying different login names from a pre-stored list and, upon identifying a login with a "Wrong password!" response, proceeds to iteratively guess the password by monitoring response times and appending characters accordingly until "Connection success!" is achieved. Networking, socket programming and basic cybersecurity knowledge.
- **Text Generator** (https://github.com/Milltrader/TextGenerator): 
The code tokenizes text from a user-specified file into words using the NLTK library, categorizes them into starting, body, and ending words based on capitalization and punctuation, and then generates 10 random sentences using a bigram model and certain rules for sentence construction. The generated sentences attempt to start with a capitalized word and ensure proper ending punctuation while adhering to some specified length constraints. Natural language processing, tokenization regex, randomization1. 

 **Data Analysis** 
- **HR Data Analysis** (https://github.com/Milltrader/redesigned-goggles/blob/main/HR%20Data%20Analysis.py): 
The code downloads three XML files containing employee data if they aren't locally available, loads them into Pandas DataFrames, and merges them for analysis. Various data manipulations and analyses, including the creation of pivot tables and conditional filtering, are performed on the merged data to explore employee characteristics and trends across different departments and conditions.
- **NBA Data Preprocessing** (https://github.com/Milltrader/redesigned-goggles/blob/main/NBA_data_preprocessing.py): The script performs a data preparation and pre-processing pipeline for a dataset related to NBA players with an intent to ready it for future machine learning analysis. It automatically downloads the dataset if not locally available, cleans and manipulates the data (like calculating new features and converting variables), addresses multicollinearity, and finally, standardizes numerical features and one-hot encodes categorical features, thus providing cleaned and transformed data for model development.
- **Hospital Data Analysis** (https://github.com/Milltrader/redesigned-goggles/blob/main/hospital_data_analysis.py): The code performs several data manipulation and visualization tasks on medical data from three different types of hospitals using the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries
